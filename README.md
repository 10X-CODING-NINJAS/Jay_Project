# QR Attendance App

Welcome to the **QR Attendance App**, a universal React Native application built using [Expo Router](https://expo.dev/router). This app streamlines event attendance by scanning QR codes containing participant details and marking them locally — no server required!

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **QR Code Scanning** – Scan QR codes using your phone's camera.
- 👤 **Local Matching** – Match scanned data (`name`, `regno`, `event_id`) against a locally stored attendee list.
- 🔐 **Appwrite Authentication** – Sign up and log in securely with Appwrite.
- 🌐 **PWA Support** – Installable as a web app with "Add to Home Screen" functionality.
- 🧭 **Expo Router Navigation** – Organized using file-based routing.
- 📄 **Attendance Log** – View scanned and marked attendees within the app.
